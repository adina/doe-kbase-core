doe-kbase-core
==============

The repository for workflow development to integrate in-house workflows into KBase.  These scripts integrate assemblies, abundances, and annotations into a Phyloseq object, specifically genes which are core among multiple metagenomes.

Many of the files are also stored on a KBase server because they are larger.
